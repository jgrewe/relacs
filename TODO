- dynclamp syncmode: ttlpulse data contains more bits than the syncpulse. Why?

- Actually used sampling rate will certainly differ from the one requested!!! How to deal with that??? In particular with high AO rates in case of auditory stimuli?
  - OutData::setStepsize should set the stepsize as requested
    AnalogOutput and children (linuxdevices and simulation) should then use setStepsize to avoid infinite loops!
  - OutData::setSampleRate/Interval should check and return the rate that can really be set
  - Maximum sampling rate should initially be adjusted for what can be supported!
  - AnalogOutput devices need to set/return what sampling rate was really used.
  - Then fix OutData::fill, OutData::load (interpolation might be required!)
  - How should OutData Wave functions deal with stepsize requests? Remove it entirely?
    But: when building ams a lower sampling rate migh suffice (a high one would not hurt either!)

- OutData::operator+=(&OutData): check if a section with the same name already exists. If yes we must give it a name.

- RePros need to set stimulus descriptions as Mutable if a corresponding parameter is mutable.

- Zooming in trace window does not work properly. Easiest could be to kill the zoom stack.
- auditory::singlestimulus and others: how to handle complicated file names? With +-() etc?


- RELACSPlugin adjust*(): in case of source != 0 should find the physical trace
- ! warning in write() -> previous signal still pending in SaveFiles ! happens after interruption of repros with a macros
- Plot (used from ManualJAR) P.clear(); P.draw() do not always clear the plot!
- Buzzing is not responsive: allow for multiple buzzes

New InData threading:
- analog  outputs with delay might not deliver enough data: comedi output should not need to be canceled in prepareWrite, daqflex should not have an underrun condition
- DAQFlexAnalogOutput: output range (bipolar/unipolar) is never set!
- check for XXX in RelacsWidget
- check and improve AudioMonitor input data updates - are they locked? 
- carefully check how signaltime is set in all the traces! (Consistency with stimulusdelay repro!)
  the resulting index should be the one of the first data of the stimulus.
- How to propagate a new recording event from SaveFiles back to the raw data (SaveFiles::openFiles)?
- What about recording events (SignalTime, locking)?
- Add Model data also to UpdateRawData?
- Simplify and unify the diverse RePro::sleep() functions. Add a waitOnSignal() ?
- Check InData::mode() usage, in particular AdjustField in FilterDetectors
- Replace the source() flag by a sourceTrace and sourceEvent index
  Remove the source mapping functions from RELACSPlugin and FilterDetectors
- AnalogInput/Output check usage of IsPrepared and IsRunning! Yes, do it!
  AI->startRead() should work after AI->stop() without prepareRead()! (restartRead()!)
- readData() several attemps only if maxn is too small
- DAQFlex: does not like writes at high sampling rates.
  The startwrite message blocks forever, while new data are read in.
- DAQFlex error handling needs to be improved, 
  e.g. invalid sampling rate and stall after write with high sampling rate.
- Rethink activateGains(): DynClamp can handle this without restarting and 
  by passing a flag through the FIFO.

Dynamic clamp:
- Linux kernel path in module Makefile should be set by relacs_rtai/dynclamp
- Serial console debugging instructions:
  https://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/kernel-lockup.htm
- Hard Lockup RTAI Debuggig: http://segfaultsarecool.blogspot.de/2012/03/debugging-hard-lockup-with-rtai.html
- Make lookup tables stronger! Add variables and function for linear
  interpolation. Models can then have a define with a meaningful name
  to return the interpolated value.
- If a model requires lookup tables, but they are not enabled, it
  should return an error. Not in initModel but somewhere in or close
  to generateLookupTabel.
- It shoud be sufficient to initially set the AOs to zero (the driver should do that: done)
  and the parameters to their initial vallues (done - check!).
- the system() call in macros.cc line 2342 hangs relacs on startup. Run it in the background?! Check it!
- matchTraces should set error string of device, and this should be used by relacswidget
- DynClamAnalogInput improve error checking in readData()
- Add a variable lastInterval that is set to the current period length in addition to loopInterval
- patchclamp::singlestimulus and ficurve should save all traces!
- check trigger
- shouldn't it be better if the model would get the parameter first,
  then computes, and then analog output takes place?

SaveFiles:
- check locking of dataindex in SaveFiles and DataBrowse.
- where does stimulus intensity go, if there is no amplifier?
  (e.g. patchclamp::MembraneResistance)
- recording-events.dat: is that absolute time, or does this reflect pauses in recordings?
- remove signalPending() and clearSignals() once the warning does not occur anymore.
- combine the file lists from storeFile() and removeFiles() ?
- Improve SaveFiles: no hand coded saving of sections, all should be done with saveXML()!
- finish reorganization of saveStimuli(): check XXX comments

Options:
- RePro: when the RePro changes an Option in main(), 
  this change should automatically be made permanent
  (via setToDefaults() called after main()? E.g. SetInputGain RePro).
- Make all Options and optWidget style flags an enum
- ConfigDialog: name should be the Options::name! Maybe already in ConfigClass?
- OutData: rename Ident to name OR remove it?
- DeviceList and FilterDetectors (and others?) should use plugin name (ident) as section name.
- check config files (in particular empty comments, units in lists [a, b, ckHz], etc!)
- are uniqueNames also used for relacsplugins.cfg ?
- operator[] and section() should only return Parameter/Options from this Options
  BUT: auditory::session::notifyMetaData!
- Check and update how plugins save data and use settings() and stimulusData()

Devices:
- Device menu should be hierarchically using section structure of device infos.
- Attenuate uses the configure mechanism, so it should inherit ConfigClass
- Attenuate should also have a dialog
- Once the Devices inherit options, AnalogOutput::setDelay() should set the corresponding option.
- AnalogInput: getAISyncDevice and take() AIRate might be combined into a single thing
- DAQFlex: See email on firmware update from 2012

patchclamp::SingleStimulus:
- Add zero to noise stimuli (all stimuli?)
- Check offset settings, are they relative to the previous last output value???

General:
- how to handle kernel modules:
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comedi_list/MbcD6Ml-HDU/vf4X89V93PgJ
- relacshelp should know whether doxygen is there, or whether the files it is operating on, exist.
- add a README file to share/relacs/configs/
- check device config files
- check all config files
- update m4 files: relacs_sndfile is most up to date

Robot:
- Remove RELACS_COND_TML from plugins/base/src/Makefile.am once the necessary functionality has been moved back to Manipulator

Acquire:
- levels(), minLevel() and other Attenuate properties should all go
  into Attenuate in case of NoAttenuator!
- How to make sure the right Attenuate is used for a given RePro?

Metadata support of OutData:
- The following RePros still need to be updated for an appropriate OutData::description:
  auditory: adaptedficurve!!!, syslatency
  auditoryprojects: spikeprecision
  efield: jar
  efish: chirps!!!
  patchclamp: simple
  patchclampprojects: thresholdlatencies, feedforwardnetwork
- Remove OutData::ident()
- Check loading of metadata descriptions from stimulus files in OutData::load(),
  check usage in auditory::singlestimulus, efield::jar, etc.
- OutData::repeat() with pause.
- OutData::setSampleRate should update timing information in the descriptions? See efish::SAM for the recorded EOD stimulus. No this should be solved by interpolation.
- Implement oprators =, +, etc. for OutData such that they take descriptions into account!
  (i.e. in isoresponse, spikeprecision, efield::beats, efish::filestimulus, patchclamp::singlestimulus, OutData::maximize())
- Remove most of the OutData constructors that resize the data? You should use *Wave() instead!
- How should setIntensity() interact with amplitudes and intensities in signal descriptions?
- Where does setIntensity() get its unit from for descriptions?
- Check usages of some "header" information in
  auditory::singlestimulus, auditoryprojects::spikeprecision.cc, patchclamp::singlestimulus, etc.
- Can OutDataInfo, which is only used in SaveFiles, be replaced by Options or OutData/OutList with a copy function that only copies members but no data?
- Check how OutList.description() can be used in SaveFiles
- Check whether OutData/List.desription() can be filled up in SaveFiles
  and then passed to DataIndex - YES!
- ThresholdLatencies: check stimulus descriptions
- Add ramp and appendRamp functions to OutData that set also the descriptions
- Update odML terminologies accordingly.
- Stimulus section needs a file (if available)!
- sineWave() can be stimulus or carrier with const AM. How to deal with that?
  Even worse: what is that two-frequency stimulus in isoresponse?

Locking:
- DeviceList functions like updateData need to be locked!
- RELACSWidget:: write() should unlock InData!?!
- dead locks: do we need to take care about blocking lockMutex() in accept(), reset(), etc.?

Macros:
- macro start should be reported in stimulus.dat including parameter
- check online message command and a following RePro (will be part of the message!)
- Remove quotes from message
- delete all MacroCommands after usage!
- The menu of a MacroCommand should have the options of the called Macro with
  overwritten Options colored blue (same as for the repros).
- The menu of a MacroCommand should display overwritten values.
- add new macro command to set all sorts of internal Options (e.g. stimulusData!)
- add dialog macro command for launching macro and repro dialogs, meta data dialog, etc.
- Macro Options and Macro stack (B R N keys) do not work together
- Add possibility to call shell command that returns a command line,
   e.g. RePro call, for the Macros
- Possibility to quit a macro after the current RePro finished normally
  (similar to break, but without softStopRequest).

Numerics:
- Problems with the pow function (in containerfuncs.h): bug in xarray.cc
- LinearRange: check overflow in NSize due to too small stepsize in
   constructors and resize, etc. and throw a warning (this happens
   in EventData when working with microseconds spikes and the default
   stepsize)
- Check EventData, how we could avoid this problem
- EventList should not bee a vector!

Plugin documentation:
- Each publication should get a file indicating the RePros it used:
  - list for each publication the used RePros
  - show in the plugin summaries for each RePro the number of publications
  - add a section to each RePro linking to its publications
- Need to document the comedi and dynclamp plugins!
- Option for automatic screenshot at the end of stimulus (in menu)

Plot:
- change zoom behavior on axis (centered)
- make the zoom stack optional - remember only the default range or a maximum number of stack frames
- add min/maxZoomRanges to optionally restrict zooming
- Plot::DataElement should have a MapD from which the plot is drawn using *double pointers,
  CopyData should copy the data within the plot() functions to this buffer,
  KeepData should do this within the draw() function
- Plot::draw() should do all the initialization and only defer the plotting itself.
- check alignment of grid with plotted lines at various plot widget sizes!

Analog Input/Output:
- Replace Ident by Name in InData, OutData, TraceSpec
- check and improve writeReset and writeZero interfaces and implementations.
- directWrite implementation should take care about synchronization as well!
  ComediAnalogOutput should use instruction lists for this.
- Add error messages string to all devices that can be set especially from the open() call.
- Comedi autotools check: old comedi versions do not have the setrouting function

Thread safety:
- make sure that any QWidget does not raise, lower, close, update, repaint, erase, 
  (i.e. calls a function that triggers an Qt event) outside the GUI thread!
  - show & hide: in Macros::loadMacros(), in RePros::raise(), in OptWidget::assign(),
    OptDialog::exec(), in auditory::Session
- make sure that all RePro, Macro, and Session starting and stopping is
  done from the GUI thread only!
- disentangle start and stopSession calls?
- OptWidget::assign is not thread safe

Acquisition interface:
- check whether test, prepare, and start can be used simulataneously with read/write
- add single data read and write

Plugins:
- Add a dependency virtual function, that can be used to query all the plugins
  (and traces?) this plugin depends on. 
  - Autoload missing control plugins?
  - Add return values to a doxygen section of the docu.
- Put relacs configuration files in root directory of ALL the plugin sets

Relacs:
- Check and clean up RELACSPlugin and RePro public/protected/private functions.
- Parameter/Options/OptWidget: generalize selectText() and index() to all types
- Fix command line arg names from path to dir in relacsmain and RELACSWidget.
- Use QLibrary instead of dlopen for loading plugins.
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  -> On/off by user?
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log?
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)

Documentation:
- Update relacshelp and createweb for different versions of doxygen
  (it works on my laptop but not on the PC - version 1.7.4)
- check relacshelp.mk and the help line in doxygen.mk for abs_build_dir!
- Update doxygen dot settings
- Update Makefile instructions to autotools
- You may want to use: ./configure --htmldir=DOCDIR/html
- Static libraries are disabled by default, enable with --enable-static
- Mention that all m4/ , *.mk , and Doxyfile files are identical and should remain so
- Hint to 
  Integrating Qt's Meta object compiler (moc) with GNU Automake
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=133
  and
  The Autotools file jungle (== version 3)
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=131
- when changing the interface of the libraries 
  make sure that nothing is installed in prefix/lib!
  For finalizing a change in the interface the version number of the library
  needs to be changed.
- For developing: make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain pathes to any relacs libraries,
  best is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""
- Add brief documentation to the examples! (a README file)

Libraries:
- Add relacs library tests to the libraries!
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( gnits )
- autoreconf:
  * configure.ac.in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
  * Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

Autotools:
- Make datatools a separate project
- Check m4 macro style
- Check for C++ requirements (STL, templates)
- Math library check: LT_LIB_M
- moc3.mk: clean-am should be clean-local, but this is not called from Makefile!
  However, why is this clean-am not overriding the original clean-am?
- We need GNU make for the moc rules. And therefore test for GNU make.
  However, can't we use from automake "18.2 Handling new file extensions"
  something like:
  SUFFIXES = .h .moc.cc
  .h.moc.cc :
	$(MOC) -i -o "$@" "$<"
  However, the header files are not in the same directory!
- Add rand55 test and make sure that the dox file PREDEFINED variable gets HAVE_LIBRAND55 define set
  http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- upgrade to Automake 1.10.1 and add LZMA support, remove .zip archives
- uninstall: also remove relacs subdirectories?!
- make distcheck: 
  release.sh /home/jan/prj/relacs/relacsinstall

Distribution details:
- Look through and clean up utils/ folder
  update & install: bin2wav (--help and --version)
  update & install: uw2sw
  update & dist: remotebackup
  update & install: scaninf scaninf.doc
  update: stopjobs
  update: updatefiles
  help: svn-*



---------------------------------

Adjust input range:
  - outsource this in a control widget or to the PlotTrace widget.
  - Search/FIField: slower change of input range!
    * option: increase range only
    * decrease range after n stimuli only

SpikeDetector: 
  - Add plot showing the time evolution of the spike size.
  - Save this trace!

Devices:
  - Add and implement probe() and possibly requires() function
  - implement "dummy (DocDevice)" devices that only get infos from
    the config file and thus serve as documentation of all the used hardware.

OutData, Acquire:
 - handle unset SampleInterval

RELACS:
 - "labbook/protocol/log" options as a tab along with the session
   for recording manual manipulations of the experiment.
   Saved directly in the trigger.dat file and
   available to the RePros. 

A new Tab-Widget Container:
 - show tabs only if more than one tab
 - switch between tabs with shift-arrow left/right
 - minimizable
 - button menu on right click
 - use for detectors and sessions and repros
 - -> QDockWidgets !

Finding a P-Unit:
 - Phase-locked spike response?
   If not it might be a Pd feedback fiber (at 80-100Hz).
 - SAM: P-Unit fires only on rising face, 
   5Hz beat, 20% Contrast, 10 beat cycles.
